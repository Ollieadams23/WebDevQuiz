      "question": "What is the correct way to declare a variable in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "var myVariable = 5;",
        "variable myVariable = 5;",
        "v myVariable = 5;",
        "declare myVariable = 5;"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The 'var' keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. You can also use 'let' or 'const' in modern JavaScript (ES6+)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which method adds an element to the end of an array?",
      "options": [
        "push()",
        "pop()",
        "shift()",
        "unshift()"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does '===' check in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "Value and type equality",
        "Value equality only",
        "Type equality only",
        "Reference equality only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The === operator checks for strict equality, meaning both value and type must be the same. Unlike ==, it does not perform type coercion."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a primitive data type in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "Object",
        "String",
        "Number",
        "Boolean"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Object is not a primitive data type. The primitive types are: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, and BigInt."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What will 'typeof null' return?",
      "options": [
        "object",
        "null",
        "undefined",
        "number"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This is a known JavaScript quirk. 'typeof null' returns 'object', which is actually a bug in JavaScript that has been kept for backward compatibility."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How do you write a comment in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "// This is a comment",
        "<!-- This is a comment -->",
        "# This is a comment",
        "/* This is a comment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Single-line comments in JavaScript use //. Multi-line comments use /* */. HTML comments (<!-- -->) and Python-style (#) comments don't work in JavaScript."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the output of: console.log(2 + '2')?",
      "options": [
        "22",
        "4",
        "Error",
        "undefined"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "JavaScript performs type coercion. When you add a number and a string, the number is converted to a string, resulting in string concatenation: '22'."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which keyword is used to define a constant in JavaScript?",

        "const",
        "constant",
        "var",
        "let"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The 'const' keyword is used to declare constants in JavaScript. Unlike 'var' and 'let', the value cannot be reassigned after declaration."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the 'return' statement do in a function?",
      "options": [
        "Exits the function and optionally returns a value",
        "Restarts the function",
        "Declares a variable",
        "Prints to console"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The 'return' statement exits the function immediately and can optionally pass a value back to the caller. Any code after 'return' will not execute."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which method removes the last element from an array?",
      "options": [

        "push()",
        "shift()",
        "unshift()"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the correct syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)",
        "for i = 0 to 5",
        "for (i = 0; i < 5)",
        "loop (i = 0; i < 5; i++)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax includes initialization (let i = 0), condition (i < 5), and increment (i++) separated by semicolons within parentheses."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does 'NaN' stand for in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "Not a Number",
        "Null and Negative",
        "New Array Number",
        "Never a Null"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "NaN stands for 'Not a Number' and represents a value that is not a legal number. Interestingly, typeof NaN returns 'number'."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which operator is used for strict inequality in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "!==",
        "!=",
        "<>",
        "=/="
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The !== operator checks for strict inequality, comparing both value and type. The != operator only checks value with type coercion."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the scope of a variable declared with 'let'?",
      "options": [
        "Block scope",
        "Global scope",
        "Function scope",
        "Module scope"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Variables declared with 'let' have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block (curly braces) where they are defined."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How do you create an empty array in JavaScript?",
      "options": [

        "let arr = {};",
        "let arr = <>"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Square brackets [] create an empty array. Curly braces {} create an empty object. Parentheses () are used for grouping or function calls."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What will 'Boolean(0)' return?",

        "0",
        "null"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In JavaScript, 0 is a falsy value. When converted to a boolean using Boolean(), it returns false. Other falsy values include '', null, undefined, and NaN."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which method converts a string to lowercase?",

      "id": 18,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a callback function in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "A function passed as an argument to another function",
        "A function that returns another function",
        "A function that calls itself",
        "A function that runs automatically"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed inside that function. Callbacks are commonly used for asynchronous operations."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the 'this' keyword refer to in JavaScript?",
      "options": [
        "The object that is executing the current function",
        "The previous object",
        "The global window object always",
        "The parent function"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The 'this' keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the function. Its value depends on how the function is called (context)."
