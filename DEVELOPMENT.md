## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup

**Chosen Theme:** Web Development Fundamentals (Multi-Category Quiz)

**Four Categories:**

3. **HTML & CSS Basics** - HTML tags, CSS selectors, properties, and structure
4. **Git & GitHub** - Version control concepts, commands, and workflows

**Reasoning:** These categories cover the essential skills I'm learning in web development. Creating quiz questions will reinforce my knowledge while building a practical project. The multi-category approach demonstrates versatility and allows users to test different aspects of web development.
